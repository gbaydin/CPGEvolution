CPGEvolution
============

Evolution of central pattern generators for the control of a five-link planar bipedal walking mechanism. The physics engine, musculoskeletal system, neural network loop, and genetic algorithms are coded in C#. Several versions of the PICBASIC code for the BasicStamp II interface circuit for the hardware implementation of the robot are given under the "BasicStamp" folder.
